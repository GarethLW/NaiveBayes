  | I'm hoping that all people with no additional sequences will notice are
  | purely cosmetic changes.

Well, first, when exmh (the latest one with your changes) starts, I get...

can't read "flist(totalcount,unseen)": no such element in array
    while executing
"if {$flist(totalcount,$mhProfile(unseen-sequence)) > 0} {
	FlagInner spool iconspool labelup
    } else {
	FlagInner down icondown labeldown
    }"
    (procedure "Flag_MsgSeen" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Flag_MsgSeen"
    (procedure "MsgSeen" line 8)
    invoked from within
"MsgSeen $msgid"
    (procedure "MsgShow" line 12)
    invoked from within
"MsgShow $msgid"
    (procedure "MsgChange" line 17)
    invoked from within
"MsgChange 4862 show"
    invoked from within
"time [list MsgChange $msgid $show"
    (procedure "Msg_Change" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Msg_Change $msg(id) $show"
    (procedure "Msg_Show" line 7)
    invoked from within
"Msg_Show cur"
    ("eval" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"eval $msgShowProc"
    (procedure "FolderChange" line 55)
    invoked from within
"FolderChange inbox {Msg_Show cur}"
    invoked from within
"time [list  FolderChange $folder $msgShowProc"
    (procedure "Folder_Change" line 3)
    invoked from within
"Folder_Change $exmh(folder)"
    (procedure "Exmh" line 101)
    invoked from within
"Exmh"
    ("after" script)

which is probably related to my not having an "unseen" sequence anywhere
(certainly not in inbox) - I read all of my outstanding mail before I
tried this new exmh ...

Second, I've been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen
which doesn't seem to exist any more, and I'm not sure what I should replace
that with.   There's obviously a way as the "Sequences" menu does this.
The "Mark Unseen" menu entry in the message "More" menu is still wanting
that function as well...

  | For those who have other sequences defined, the window will widen to
  | display the other sequences.

Any chance of having that lengthen instead?   I like all my exmh stuff
in nice columns (fits the display better).   That is, I use the detached
folder list, one column.   The main exmh window takes up full screen,
top to bottom, but less than half the width, etc...

I have space for more sequences, in the "unseen" window, as long as they
remain once nice narrow window (best would be if the sequences could be
ordered by some preference, then ones which didn't fit would just fall
off the bottom, and not be shown).

I'd also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring,
just one constant colour - I have been running the unseen window with
background black, on a root window that is all black, with no borders or
other decorations, but made "sticky" - the appearance is just like the
folders with unseen messages (and their counts) are written into the
root window (because it is sticky, this small display follows me around
and do I can see when new mail needs processing).

I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur
in one folder (some I had forgotten I ever created).  So in addition to
the "sequences to always show" and "sequences to never show", a
preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder
would be useful, and then have the sequences that occor only in the
folder I'm visiting appear in the list when that folder is current.
This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining
productive (I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message
in a folder - the name is used only there, and only for one message,
it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is
packed, sorted, etc).

I haven't updated my exmh for some time now, so I'm not sure if this
next one is new, or just new since 2.5, but the Sequences menu (on the
bar with New Flist Search ...) only contains "unseen" and "urgent".
It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder
happens to have defined.   A "New sequence" entry would also be useful
(to mark the message with a sequence name that didn't previously exist,
which can be done now using "Search" and the pick interface, but is
clumsy that way)

Actually, you once could, now when I try this, entering a sequence name
in the pick box, and a single message number, or a range N-N in the
list of messages, and no pick attributes at all, I now get ...

syntax error in expression "int(1+1+(1 hit-1)*(3868-1-2)/(4878-1))"
    while executing
"expr int($minlineno+1+($msgid-$minmsgid)*($maxlineno-$minlineno-2)/($maxmsgid-$minmsgid))"
    (procedure "Ftoc_FindMsg" line 46)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_FindMsg $msg"
    (procedure "Ftoc_FindMsgs" line 5)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_FindMsgs $msgids"
    (procedure "Ftoc_PickMsgs" line 5)
    invoked from within
"Ftoc_PickMsgs $pick(ids) $pick(addtosel)"
    (procedure "PickInner" line 13)
    invoked from within
"PickInner {exec pick +inbox -list} {4852 -sequence mercury}"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 $cmd"
    (procedure "busyCursorInner" line 8)
    invoked from within
"busyCursorInner $cmd $widgets"
    (procedure "busyCursorHack" line 32)
    invoked from within
"busyCursorHack $args"
    ("cursor" arm line 1)
    invoked from within
"switch $busy(style) {
	icon		{busyIcon $args}
	cursorAll	{busyCursor $args}
	cursor		{busyCursorHack $args}
	default		{eval $args}
    }"
    (procedure "busy" line 3)
    invoked from within
"busy PickInner $cmd $msgs"
    (procedure "Pick_It" line 51)
    invoked from within
"Pick_It"
    invoked from within
".pick.but.pick invoke"
    ("uplevel" body line 1)
    invoked from within
"uplevel #0 [list $w invoke]"
    (procedure "tkButtonUp" line 7)
    invoked from within
"tkButtonUp .pick.but.pick
"
    (command bound to event)

It has been ages since I did this last though.   I tried adding a Subject
to pick on (easy as I know what's in the message...) which made no difference.
Looks as if something is now saying "1 hit" when before it didn't, or
similar.

  | I've also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the list a 
  | week or so ago.

Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does (maybe this is
more apparent to me than many, as I use very small fonts everywhere,
the background of the ftoc line isn't very wide).

Hope this helps.

I've never seen pseq either.

BTW, it's kinda amusing for a short while to show the cur sequence.  Watching 
that helped me find a number of bugs.
